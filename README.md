# React Role-Based UI Rendering

This project is a prototype of a React.js application that showcases role-based UI rendering. The UI components and functionalities are tailored based on the role of the logged-in user.

# Important Note : 

**This prototype intentionally does not include a comprehensive authentication or authorization system.**
 **The dashboard functionalities are not functional and are included solely to demonstrate the different UI layouts based on the user's role.**
 **different sidebar menu items for the admin and user**
 **less dashboard cards for a simple user than the admin**

*The primary goal of this prototype is to illustrate how React.js can dynamically render different UI components based on the user's role.*
*It implements a simple role-based access control system to manage user permissions and access to specific features.*
